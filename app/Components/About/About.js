        I am a 32-year-old development enthusiast living in Italy. My adventure
        in the world of programming took shape when I discovered this discipline
        by watching several programming videos. I fell in love with the art of
        using creativity to build things for the web. I made the decision to
        discontinue my high school studies and pursue a career in coding, facing
        challenges along the way. Through perseverance, self-discipline, and
        commitment, I was able to realize my goal of becoming a frontend
        developer and am studying to become a fullstack! What has kept me on
        this path is the continuous excitement in learning new things and facing
        unknown challenges. In addition to coding, I enjoy doing personal
        projects that allow me to explore my creativity and accomplish exciting
        things.
