        I am a 32-years-old FrontEnd Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Over time, I have expanded my skill set to include modern
        libraries and frameworks such as React, Next.js, and Redux. To enhance
        the styling of my projects, I also use SCSS for cleaner and more
        maintainable code. Additionally, I am proficient in using Git and GitHub
        for version control and have experience with design tools like Figma. My
        goal is to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications,
        continuously improving my skills and keeping up with the latest industry
        trends.
